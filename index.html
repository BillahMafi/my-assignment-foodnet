            <h3>Beef Steak recipe</h3>
            <img src="images/Project Cover1.jpg">
            <p>In the United States, a restaurant that specializes in beef steaks is a steakhouse. The more expensive steakhouses serve the highest grades of beef and often dry-age it for many weeks. The well-aged beef cooked on high-heat grills and broilers produces a steak difficult to emulate in a home kitchen.[citation needed </p>
